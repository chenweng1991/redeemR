\usage{
ProgenyMapping_np(

  CloneCol = "Clone_merge",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{HSC_mitoTracing}{The HSC_mitoTracing is the mitoTracing object for defined HSC,  have already gone through Add_DepthMatrix--Add_AssignVariant--Add_tree_cut, otherwise, need
othereise, need a column in CellMeta that indicates the clone ID}

\item{Full_mitoTracing}{The FULL_mitoTracing is the mitoTracing object for the full BMMC_HSPC_HSC}

\item{CloneCol}{"Clone_merge"}

\item{k}{the k.param used for MNN graph}

\item{gm}{gamma default is 0.05 which mean 95\% information is passing out}

\item{ProbCut}{The cutoff of the maximum probability for a given progeny cell(If the maximum probability is lower than ProbCut, it will be filtered)}

\item{Celltype}{The column to be used in aggregate into lineages}
}
\value{
a list of two  ALLmeta.npClone (A meta data with last column npClone), np_mat (the network propagation matrix))
